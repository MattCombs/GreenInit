      <span class="h1letter">B</span>altimore is in need of great change. The city itself is beautiful and filled with amazing, creative people. It is a hub for innovation - the “silicon valley” of the east coast. Yet Baltimore has been painted red by the media. They irritate the dark times in Baltimore’s past and leave no time for growth and healing. Baltimore, just like any city, has its scars, but now is the time to enact change and empower Baltimore to be ranked number one for greenest city, as well as the most sustainable city in America. If you want the young entrepreneurs and innovators to swarm your city? There is no better way than to be a leader in sustainability.

  <h1>| About |</h1>
    <p>
      Matt Combs is a social entrepreneur who wants to see long-term sustainable and green change in the world. On a recent trip, he witnessed Shanghai actively solving their pollution problem by bringing trees, gardens, and plants back into the city. He was able to see the solution work first hand, and wants to expand on what he saw to fix a bigger problem here. He took all the “good ideas” that had already been implemented, and married them all together to de-solve many problems with a single well thought out, and easy to implement solution. Matt has always been a catalyst and is now once again encompassing the roll through the Green Initiative Project.
